        <br />
        <span>
            My role was to develop the website for Enactus, DDUC based on a provided design. This involved
            translating
            design mockups into a fully functional and responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
            collaborated closely with the design team to ensure the website met all visual and functional
            requirements.
            During my internship, I honed my skills in front-end development, learned effective communication and
            coordination within a team, and improved my ability to work efficiently under deadlines.

                <span style="font-weight: 800;">Dog breed identification using YOLOv5</span>
                <br />
                <span>Developed a dog breed classification system using YOLOv5 and finetuned it by training on a custom
                    dataset
                    so
                    that the model can accurately identify
                    dog breeds and annotate them. The model was trained on the Stanford dog dataset and fine-tuned to
                    handle
                    a
                    wide variety of dog breeds and
                    integrated with efficient preprocessing techniques to ensure high prediction accuracy. The system
                    was
                    deployed as a web application using Flask,
                    allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions through a simple and intuitive
                    interface.

                <span style="font-weight: 800;">Youtube comments classifier using LSTM</span>
                <br />
                <span>This project involves developing a deep learning model to classify user comments into three
                    categories:
                    doubt, irrelevant, and feedback. The data is
                    preprocessed by tokenizing and padding text, while the labels are one-hot encoded for compatibility
                    with
                    the
                    neural network. The model leverages
                    an LSTM-based architecture, combining an embedding layer for text representation, recurrent layers
                    for
                    capturing sequential dependencies, and a
                    dense layer for classification. After training, the model achieves reasonable accuracy and an
                    evaluation
                    is
                    conducted using metrics like F1 score to
                    measure its performance on unseen data.

                <br />
                <span>This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Pokémon based on their
                    attributes.
                    It
                    includes data preprocessing, visualization,
                    and training classification models like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Model
                    performance is evaluated using metrics like
                    accuracy to optimize predictions.

                <br />
                <span>This project was made as part of a hackathon. The idea was to make an OTT platform which was easy
                    to
                    use
                    and navigate and feels asthetically
                    pleasing with subtle animations. We used React to make our project using MUI components.
